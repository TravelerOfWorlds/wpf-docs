# UML Diagrams
The primary purpose of UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams is to provide a standardized way of representing the different aspects of a system, *making it easier for software developers, analysts, and other stakeholders to communicate and understand the system's structure and behavior*.
UML Behavioral Diagrams are used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the dynamic aspects of a system. *Need or Not* They aid in previewing and determining the model, execution flow, state, or behavior of the system at a specific time. 

## UML Diagram Shapes
The process of creating UML Diagrams involves selecting and combining different UML shapes to visually represent the system's architecture.==Line Need?== Each shape has a specific meaning and usage, contributing to the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the diagram.

The list of UML Diagram Shapes are available in the diagram resource dictionary, as follows:
